# Tic-Tac-Toe Simulator in Python

**Description**

This is my tic-tac-toe simulator in Python. It was written as the answer to Assignment 2 of the course "Python for Research" offered by Harvard University on the edX platform. Do feel free to let me know your feedback through the comments section. Thanks !

**Compatibility**

This code has been developed and tested well on Windows 10 in the Jupyter Notebook environment (specifically, the Anaconda distribution).

### Instructions

- To run the simulator in a Jupyter Notebook environment or similiar, download, open, and run the tic-tac-toe-simulator.ipynb file. To run it in a different environment, simply open the source code file in github itself, copy, paste, and run it in your environment.
 
### Results

- When a playing strategy where Player 1 always starts with the middle square, and otherwise both players place their markers randomly is used, it results in more number of wins for Player 1, at random, out of a 1000 simulated games.
- Basic Python skills strengthened.
